# descartes-github-app
GitHub application sources for Descartes

This application triggers Descartes on a pull request.
It provides feedback using the Github check run API.

To use it you just need to install it on your repository.
It is not available on the Github Marketplace, so if you want to try it, do not hesitate to contact us. :-)

We use the project 'experiments' to test this application
